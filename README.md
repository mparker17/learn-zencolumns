Learning @johnalbin's Zen Columns Layout Method. Note this is NOT [Zen Grids](http://zengrids.com/).

## History

I've known how to use [John Albin](john.albin.net)'s Zen Columns Layout Method for a number of years now, but it's useful to have a reference around to teach other people.

The Zen Columns Layout Method was originally distributed with the [Zen theme](https://drupal.org/project/zen) and had [sparse documentation](https://drupal.org/node/201428). I learned it by reducing it to the very minimum HTML and CSS needed to make it work, which I've captured here.

## License

I've licensed this under the [GPL2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html), since that's what the [Zen theme](https://drupal.org/project/zen) is licensed as.
